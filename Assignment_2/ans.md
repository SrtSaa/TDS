    # Project huB-T589hxp3 Deployment
    This document outlines the deployment process for Project huB-T589hxp3, detailing how our data product transitions from staging to production. The architecture consists of three main components: the edge cache, API tier, and background workers.

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        edge-v8r[Edge Cache]
        api-zj9atz[API Tier]
        worker-e3ibfyu6[Background Workers]

        edge-v8r --> api-zj9atz
        api-zj9atz --> worker-e3ibfyu6
    ```

    To deploy the latest version of our data product, use the `bashuv deploy hub-t589hxp3` command:


    ## Deployment Tasks
    - [x] Prepare staging environment
    - [ ] Run integration tests
    - [ ] Deploy to production

    ## Tier Summary
    | Tier               | Responsibility                     | Scaling Plan                      |
    |--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
    | Edge Cache         | Caches frequently accessed data   | Auto-scaling based on traffic      |
    | API Tier           | Handles client requests           | Horizontal scaling with load balancer |
    | Background Workers | Processes background tasks        | Scale based on job queue length    |

    [^compliance-eskxtbtq]: The audit step ensures every deployment retains traceability by capturing SHA digests, token validity, and timestamped approvals for external audits.

    This deployment process is designed to be **robust** and *efficient*, ensuring that our data product remains reliable and scalable. Please note that any changes to the deployment process must be reviewed to avoid potential issues. ~~Avoid shortcuts~~ that could compromise the integrity of the deployment.
